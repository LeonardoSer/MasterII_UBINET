# Summary

## 1) TinyML-Enabled Frugal Smart Objects: Challenges and Opportunities
- Challenges and opportunities
- Survey of tinyML frameworks for integrating ML algorithms in MCUs
- real case study discussed RAT: radio access network architecture  
- performances of a number of ML algorithms embedded in an Arduino Uno board are analyzed
- A lot of framework illustrated(**III. Tinyml Frameworks**)
- **IV. Use Case: Smart Multi-Rat Device**

the main contributions of this work are the following:
- A wide discussion of the TinyML concept as wellas the range of potentially benefited applications.
-A survey of the principal available frameworks for integrating ML algorithms within MCUs.
- Insights regarding the real implementation of ML-based schemes over frugal objects to solve the problem of intelligent interface selection in a multi-RAT set up
