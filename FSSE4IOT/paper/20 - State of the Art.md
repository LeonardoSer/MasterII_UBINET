 ## TinyML frameworks 
 
 TinyML frameworks can be categorized into three different families.
 
 1. The most common approach relates to the conversion of already trained models for adapting them to the restrictions of MCUs. Thus, these tools usually take inference engines generated by well-known ML libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn , or PyTorch , among others,and port their code in order to be executed by scarce resource devices.ù
 2. The second approach bets on integrating ML libraries within MCUs, hence providing them with local training and analysis capabilities. This permits to generate models from data retrieved by the own device, which may improve the accuracy of the model and also enables the implementation of unsupervised learning algorithms.
 3. Finally, the last approach relies on the availability of a dedicated co-processor that supports the main computing unit on ML-specific tasks. This strategy permits to enhance the computation performance, although it is the less common approach as the price and complexity of the processing platforms are notably increased.
 
  ### TensorFlow Lite (Google)
Google has launched TensorFlow Lite , which includes a set of tools to adapt Tensor Flow models aiming at making them to be runnable in mobile and embedded devices 

a number of algorithms from the NN family, can be executed in a range of plat-
forms such as smartphones, embedded Linux and MCUs.

the optimized code is provided in C++ 11 and requires 32-bit processors to be run. It has been successfully tested in devices with ARM Cortex-Mseries processors, e.g., Arduino nano, and other architectures such as ESP32.

 ### Go Adaptation (Google)
another related Google’s initiative has been the adaptation of the GO programming language to microcontrollers

### ELL (Microsoft)
Microsoft has also contributed to the TinyML scene by releasing its open source Embedded Learning Library (ELL)

This framework permits to design and deploy pre-trained ML models onto constrained platforms, e.g., ARM Cortex-A and Cortex-M architectures such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi.

### AIfES (IMS)
The Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Circuits and Systems (IMS) has developed the Artificial Intelligence for Embedded Systems (AIfES) library [44], which is a C-based and platform-independent tool for generating NNs compatible with a range of MCUs, e.g., Arduino UNO, ATMega32U4, or STM32 F4 Series.

AIfES permits to implement the NN training process on the embedded device, i.e., it belongs to the second family of frameworks identified above

### MicroML
MicroML is a project that permits to port Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithms to C code that can run in a number of MCUs, e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, and others with C support. It interoperates with the widely-used Scikit-learn toolkit and transforms the mod-
els generated by this library in order to be executed on 8-bit microcontrollers with 2 kb of RAM. Also compatible with Scikit-learn, sklearn-porter  permits to transpile trained estimators to C, Java, JavaScript, GO, Ruby, and PHP.

### EMlearn 
emlearn  is a framework that produces portable C99 code from Python libraries such as Scikit-learn or Keras. This library is compatible with generated models of a range of algorithms, e.g., RF, decision trees, Naive Bayes, or linear
models, and has been tested in different platforms, namely, AVR Atmega, ESP8266 and Linux.
