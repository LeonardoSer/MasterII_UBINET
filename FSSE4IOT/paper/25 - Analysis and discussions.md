## Communication protocols

The availability of multiple RATs embedded in the device is also one of its key characteristics. WiFi or Bluetooth are the most usual technologies as they are very well-known standards that can reach high data-rates. Other options based on cellular communications such as 4 G/5G may be also considered. However, all these RATs require great amount of energy to work. For that reason, LPWAN-based solutions such as LoRaWAN, Sigfox, or Narrow Bandâ€”Internet of Things (NB-IoT)  are currently being adopted by the IoT market as they provide very long transmission distances with highly reduced energy consumption, although with the limitation of severely limiting the transmission rate.
