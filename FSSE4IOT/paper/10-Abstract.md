# Abstract

## What TinyML is and What the paper is about

- The TinyML paradigm proposes to integrate Machine Learning
(ML)-based mechanisms within small objects powered by Mi-
crocontroller Units (MCUs)

- Novel applications and services that do not need the
omnipresent processing support from the cloud, which is power
consuming and involves data security and privacy risks.
