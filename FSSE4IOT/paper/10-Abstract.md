# Abstract

## What TinyML is and What the paper is about

The TinyML paradigm proposes to merge Machine Learning based algorithms within small objects powered by Microcontroller Units (MCUs) . The world has over 250 billion microcontrollers (IC Insights, 2020), with strong growth projected over coming years, providing them with ML capabilityes would bring a wide range of application never seen before. The scope of this work is to provide a survey of opportunieties, challenges, apllications, prospective and current frameworks available at the state of the art within this novel vibrating field.
