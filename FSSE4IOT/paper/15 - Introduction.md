# Introduction

In past decades data production has experienced unprecedented growth, Machine Learning has the opportunity to spread, revolutionioning our way of understanding the world by enabling the inference of valuable information and knowledge from huge amount of data, so far invisible to human eye.  Untill now it has exploited the data processing and storage capabilities provided by cloud technologies these large neural network models focus primarily on accuracy and speed, as they have access to unlimited computational resources and memory. 
The TinyML paradigm proposes a different approach, it wants to integrate Machine Learning based mechanisms within small objects powered by Microcontroller Units (MCUs) to have a wide range of applications and services that do not need the omnipresent processing support from the cloud, which is power consuming and involves data security and privacy risks. MCUs  instead are tiny processing entities usually embedded in daily-use appliances that can be massively produced at inexpensive cost. The spread of this frugal objects in our lives due to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) is skyrocketing, so providing them with cognitive skills bring opportunities for developing a huge number of collective intelligence applications.

The contributions of this work are: a wide discussion of the TinyML concept as well as opportunities and challenges that it brings, A view through the applications that can benefit from it and  a survey of the principal available frameworks for integrating ML within MCUs.
