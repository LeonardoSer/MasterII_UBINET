# Introduction

## What is and Why Machine Learning ? 
- Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized our way of understanding the world by enabling the inference of valuable information and knowledge from huge amount of data, so far invisible to human eye.
- Untill now it is exploiting the potential offered by state-of-the-art processors, data-centers, and supercomputers
## What are MCUs ?
- Microcontroller Units (MCUs). This tiny processing entities are usually embedded in daily-use appliances
- massively produced at inexpensive cost
- The penetration of frugal objects in our lives due to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) is skyrocketing, thus provisioning them with cognitive skills opens a plethora of opportunities for developing a widespread web of collective intelligence

## What and Why TinyML?

### Advantages 
1. Energy Efficiency
2. Low Cost - spread of iot and reprogrammability of devices
3. Latency, System Reliability and Data Security: too much communication is energy consuming, so it's better to perform computation on end systems, fewer transmission mean more reliability (fewer transmission errors and much more security (we can use more sophisticated solutions for avoiding attack because we have to transmit fewer things). this will of course reduce also latency.

### Challenges 
1. Eterogenity: too much different frugal object, different protocols 
2. MCU Constraints: from the producer prespective, those object must support a straight ML integration, local data security (we don't want an hacker have easy access to data stored by exploiting the hardware vulnerabilities -> EX "MIRIAI BOTNET ATTACK" ). From the cloud prespective, they should be able to support api for an efficent exange of data beetween devices, and guarantee Reliability in case of failure. 
3. Most of the latest efforts related to the evolution of the IoT ecosystem have focused on the development of novel communication technologies and protocols to provide end-devices with ubiquitous connectivity.
## Applications:
1. wearables such as fitness monitors or “smart” watches are not that smart, as they rely on a Bluetooth-coupled smartphone which assumes the majority of processing tasks. Integrating ML within frugal objects permits their independence from a master device, which will notably enrich current applications landscape.
2. Health monitoring, augmentedreality, real-time voice recognition, language translation
3. Smart cities or cognitive buildings, among many others. Current IoT-based monitoring and surveillance systems, e.g., traffic, pollution, crowdsensing, etc.,
4. Smart Agriculture and Farming
5. Industry
6. Cooperative—Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) will be enriched
