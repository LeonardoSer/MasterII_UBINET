 # Conclusions 
 
 The applciation of ML to the IoT ecosystem is capable of skyrocketing it's computational capabilities and possible applications. This work is has provided a general look at opportunities and challenges in the fast growing parading of TinyML, so the application of ML algorithms to a distributed network of MCUs, to bring their smart capabilities at a level never seen before. Have been illustrated constraints within those frugal object must work, and the effort related to the evolution of communication technologies and protocols neede to provide an ubiquitus connectivity with the adavantages they brings.
